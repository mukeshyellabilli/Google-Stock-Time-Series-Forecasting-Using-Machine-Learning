## Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility and randomness of financial markets. In this project, historical Google stock prices are used to build a predictive model that forecasts future stock values. The project involves applying various machine learning models that can handle time series data to understand stock price trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for Google (e.g., **open**, **high**, **low**, **close**, **volume**, etc.). The data may have been sourced from finance APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

The key features in the dataset include:
- Date
- Open Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Closing Price
- Adjusted Closing Price
- Volume

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization of stock price trends.
   - Summary statistics and distribution of features.
   - Correlation analysis between different stock features.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling.
   - Creating additional features (lag features, moving averages, etc.).
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   
3. **Time Series Modeling**:
   - Understanding the time-dependent structure of the data.
   - Ensuring stationarity of the time series (if necessary).
   
4. **Model Training and Testing**:
   - Implementing machine learning models for stock price forecasting.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

## Machine Learning Models
Several time series forecasting models were explored and implemented in this project, including:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A recurrent neural network (RNN) variant designed to handle time series data and capture long-term dependencies.
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
4. **XGBoost**: A scalable machine learning model that builds on gradient-boosting techniques.
5. **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model that fits a linear equation to observed data.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

## Results
- Comparison of model performance on the test dataset.
- Visualizing predicted vs. actual stock prices to assess model accuracy.
- Highlighting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the use of machine learning models to predict stock prices. The performance of different models was compared, and the strengths and weaknesses of each were analyzed. Although stock market prediction is inherently difficult, machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing trends and making data-driven predictions.
